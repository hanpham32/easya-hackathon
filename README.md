## Short Summary

Collaborate and advance programming workshops and challenges and earn rewards. Web3 Workshops is a central hub for workshops content for developers who look to onboard to blockchain protocols. The platform provides interactive learning, step-by-step guidance, community feedback, a ladderboard + NFT rewards for workshop completion.

## Description

Traditional workshops are usually in-person and in presentation style, where there are only minimal time for questions + engagement. Other time, workshops are conducted online asynchronously (Zoom, Google, Youtube video), or via Github README guide.

The Users may have difficult time following along the presented content. They may struggles to navigate through different developer SDKs. And at the end, their deployment, final result, may work or fail. There is a uncertainty in  outcome and success rate.

The Engineers don't have an efficient way to track completion to reward bounties. They don't have a way to be informed about the outcome of the workshop that they delivered. They don't have a record of participants of the workshop. Essentially, they lack of centralized platform to host and manage workshop contents.

### We deliver

A place to collaborate and advance programming workshops and challenges. Users can earn rewards and enjoy a good experience.

Web3 Workshops is a central hub for workshops content for developers who look to onboard to blockchain protocols. The platform provides interactive learning, step-by-step guidance, community feedback, a ladderboard + NFT rewards for workshop completion.

### How?

- Immediate repository set up
- Git integration, instant feedback git push, test user code to advance each step
- Each step will have a community chat where user can chat and brainstorm the solution
- Earn NFTs and reward tokens, or more special reward granted by the partner protocol!
- Workshop engineer who delivers content would be able to track learning outcome of participants.

## Technical Description

#### Frontend:
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- Bun
- Typescript
- React

#### Backend

- Github OAuth
- Move smart contracts for NFT collection

#### Hosting
- Vercel


## Challenges We Face
- We only had roughly two days for implementation, and last day to wrap up our presentaion and website. We faced time constraint for implementation: deploy NFT colletion, set up git server and webhooks to receive Push request.


If given more time, we can improve the UI, deploy backend server for services like storage, NFT collection, set up git repository for workshops.

## Roadmap:
We want our platform to be providing contents for diverse blockchain ecosystems (e.g. Sui, Polkadot L0 and parachains, etc.), and be the leading education platform tailored for developer learning experience.

- Finish the implementation for rewarding system, repository server, and app API endpoints.
- Collaborate with blockchain protocols to onboard workshop contents.
- The ability to write and create contents for workshop and earn rewards for teaching.
